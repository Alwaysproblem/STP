\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old\
\
benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,\
\
with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,\
\
he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.About half a dozen\
\
men came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate, he\
\
deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and\
\
brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o'clock, they observed\
\
a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for\
\
port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they\
\
did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a\
\
creek about two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of\
\
the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some\
\
distance. As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot\
\
against something and fell at his length on the ground. His companions\
\
came up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found\
\
that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance\
\
dead. Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some\
\
person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but\
\
on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that\
\
the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage\
\
of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore\
\
it to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and\
\
twenty years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was\
\
no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his\
\
neck. The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest\
\
me, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the\
\
murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs\
\
trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a\
\
chair for support. \
